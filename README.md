# Fourier Transform Mixer
The Fourier Transform Mixer is a desktop application designed to demonstrate the importance of magnitude and phase components in signal processing, particularly focusing on images. The program allows users to open and view up to four grayscale images simultaneously, visualize their Fourier Transform components, adjust brightness/contrast, mix components, select regions for mixing, and observe real-time mixing updates.

## Features:

### Image Viewers
- Open and view up to four grayscale images simultaneously.
- Automatically convert colored images to grayscale.
- Resize images to the smallest size for uniformity.
- Visualize Fourier Transform components (Magnitude, Phase, Real, Imaginary) for each image.
### Output Ports
- Display mixer results in one of two output viewports.
- Switch between output viewports as desired.
### Brightness/Contrast Adjustment
- Adjust brightness and contrast using mouse moving up, down, right and left .
- Apply adjustments to individual images and Fourier Transform components.
### Components Mixer
- Customize weights for each image's Fourier Transform components using sliders.
- Calculate weighted averages for the Fourier Transforms.
- Perform inverse Fourier Transform to obtain the output image.
### Regions Mixer
- Select inner or outer regions for Fourier Transform components.
- Highlight selected regions and adjust their size or percentage.
### Real-time Mixing
